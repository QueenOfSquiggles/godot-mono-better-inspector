# godot-mono-better-inspector
Making the Godot Editor better for C# projects with the use of Attributes, like how Unity does it!

# Integrated vs Custom

Custom is the default, but in some cases you may prefer to use Integrated.

## Integrated 
* "well integrated" with the default editor. 
* Property shows up where expected, as it always does.
* Customization is quite limited.

## Custom
* "highly customizable"
* doesn't play well with the built in functions
  * no animation keying support (_YET_)

# Attribute Reference

Note that any export variable that does not have an attribute from this plugin will be handled by the default Godot systems. Only use this were you want/need it.

## C#
Attibutes in C# are added with `[AttributeName]`. For example, the export attribute is what it used for `[Export]` variables. I defined a large set of custom attributes that allow for some extra functinality.
| Attribute | Params | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tooltip | (string) or (string, string, string ...) | loads the text into the tooltip. For custom inspectors, this is full BBCode enabled, integrated is restricted to a few BBCode options. Also if the params option is used, each string is treated as a line and line breaks are inserted between each.
| UseIntegrated| _ | forces use of the integrated
| BottomInspector | _ | forces the editor to use a more vertical display mode. Gives more space for sliders
| ReadOnly | _ | forces the inspector display to make the variable read-only, which prevents making edits while still displaying the value
| CustomLabel | (string) | Uses a custom label for the variable instead of the default name.

(list is incomplete)

## GDscript
Attributes in GDscript are generated by the plugin by parsing the source code and finding the block of double hash comments. "##"
So adding one of these would go as :

```GDScript
## this will be a tooltip
## @label this will be a custom labe;
export var someInt := 1
```
